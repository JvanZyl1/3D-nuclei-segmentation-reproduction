#### Planning
Four Criteria:

- **Replicate**: A full implementation from scratch without using any pre-existing code? (does looking at an existing implementation count?)
- **New Code Variant**: Rewrote or ported existing code to be more efficient/readable. (does reimplementing in `pytorch` count?)
- **New Data**: Evaluate different datasets to obtain similar results. (part of the assignment: replicate for new cell polarity data)

###### Pick one
- **Reproduce?**: Existing code was evaluated. (is it fine to just check the code quality, or do we have to find the original model weights and run the entire thing?)
- **Hyperparams Check**: Evaluating sensitivity to hyperparameters. 

###### Probably Not
- **New algorithm variant**: Evaluating a slightly different variant (only Dani seems to know alternatives)
- **Ablation study**: Additional ablation studies. (both NDN and NSN are dependent on each other, so not sure how to proceed.)
